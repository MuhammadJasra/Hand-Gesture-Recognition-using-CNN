# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN 🤖  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Hand Gesture Recognition** system using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **LeapGestRecog** dataset. The model classifies different hand gestures and lays the foundation for **real-time gesture recognition** using a laptop camera.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Image Preprocessing** – Converts images to grayscale, resizes to `64x64`, normalizes pixel values, and encodes gesture labels.  
✅ **Deep Learning Model** – A CNN built with **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify hand gestures accurately.  
✅ **Training & Evaluation** – Uses an **80-20 train-test split**, plots **accuracy/loss graphs**, and evaluates performance with a **confusion matrix**.  
✅ **Visualization** – Displays **sample images** before training and provides detailed evaluation metrics.  
✅ **Future Scaling** – Plans for **real-time gesture detection** using a laptop camera.
